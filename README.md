# Stochastic Piano

As a piano performer, I appreciate that deterministic interface of the piano â€“ what you hear is what you expect. However, I wondered about the effects of adding stochasticity to this interface. Would adding randomness add any utility for composers or other music generation tasks? Let's code to find out.

For the bulk of my project, I build upon this wonderful react piano component [(https://lillydinhle.github.io/react-piano-component/)]. My intervention to this codebase was the ability to control randomness through a sliding bar. More specifically, this user input corresponded to a new keyboard mapping. Initial attempts shuffling the mapping with some fixed probabilities caused unsatisfying and overly chaotic results.

To better preserve locality, I applied [Heap's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap%27s_algorithm#:~:text=Heap's%20algorithm%20generates%20all%20possible,2%20elements%20are%20not%20disturbed.) to generate a serious of permutations. This approach allowed me to use the index in the array of the total generated permutations as a proxy for chaos.
