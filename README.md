# Stochastic Piano

As someone with a deep love for the piano, I often appreciate its deterministic interface â€“ what you hear is what you expect. However, I wondered what would happen upon injecting some stochasticity to this interface. Would adding randomness add any compositional or generative utility? 

To answer this question, I began by building upon this wonderful [react piano component](https://github.com/lillydinhle/react-piano-component). My  primary intervention to this codebase was for a user to inject randomness via a sliding bar. In the spirit of the project, I also randomly change the instrument each time the user reloads the application. Note that most of my additions can be found in src/demo/components folder, particularly InteractivePiano.js. 

## Mapping 1 
Initial attempts at shuffling the keyword mapping with some fixed probabilities caused unsatisfying and overly chaotic results. To better preserve locality, I applied [Heap's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap%27s_algorithm#:~:text=Heap's%20algorithm%20generates%20all%20possible,2%20elements%20are%20not%20disturbed.) to generate a series of permutations. This approach enables the array index with respect to all generated heap permutations to function as a proxy for chaos. 

## Mapping 2 (5/18/2022)

In another attempt to generate an random keyboard mapping, I mapped each note to a unique neighbor according to a normal distribution. In this way, the scaled standard deviation functions as a proxy for chaos.
